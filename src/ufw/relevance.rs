    // Core Focus Areas: Scientific research (physics, chemistry, biology), optimization (supply chain, logistics, finance), and AI (machine learning, natural language processing).
    // Keywords/Attributes:
    // - Scientific: "simulation," "model," "analysis," "experiment," specific scientific terms.
    // - Optimization: "efficiency," "cost reduction," "resource allocation," "scheduling."
    // - AI: "machine learning," "neural network," "natural language processing," "computer vision."

fn calculate_real_world_impact(problem: &UsefulWorkProblem) -> u32 {
    // Placeholder for real-world impact calculation
    // Metrics:
    // - Scientific: Number of citations, publications in high-impact journals, patents filed.
    // - Optimization: Cost savings, efficiency gains (measured in percentages or absolute values).
    // - AI: Accuracy improvements, speedup in processing time, novel applications.
    // Scales:
    // - Utilize standardized scales (e.g., Likert scale for subjective impact assessment).
    // - Develop custom scales based on domain-specific metrics.

    // Gauging Interest:
    // - Track user votes or "likes" on problem proposals.
    // - Monitor discussions and engagement on forums or social media platforms.
    // - Use surveys and feedback forms to gather input from the community.
    // Feedback System:
    // - Implement a system to collect and analyze user feedback on problem relevance and impact.
    // - Use this feedback to refine the problem selection algorithm over time.

    // Criteria:
    // - Publicly available datasets from reputable sources (e.g., government agencies, research institutions).
    // - Datasets that are well-documented and structured for easy processing.
    // - Datasets that are large enough to train or validate models effectively.
    // Data Sources:
    // - Check public data repositories (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository).
    // - Consider partnerships with organizations that have access to relevant data.
