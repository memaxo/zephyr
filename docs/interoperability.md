# Interoperability between Classical and Quantum Nodes

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and instructions for setting up and managing a hybrid network of classical and quantum nodes. The QUPConsensus module has been enhanced to support seamless interoperability between these node types.

## Communication Protocols

The `CommunicationProtocol` struct handles communication between nodes. It supports both classical and quantum communication methods.

### Node Types

- `NodeType::Classical`: For classical nodes.
- `NodeType::Quantum`: For quantum nodes.

### Sending and Receiving Messages

The `send_message` and `receive_message` methods handle message transmission and reception based on the node type.

## Consensus Algorithm Adaptations

The consensus algorithm has been adapted to accommodate both classical and quantum nodes. The `process_message` method now uses the `CommunicationProtocol` to handle messages.

## Setting Up a Hybrid Network

1. **Configure Node Type**: Specify the node type (classical or quantum) when initializing the `QUPConsensus` struct.
2. **Initialize Communication Protocol**: The `CommunicationProtocol` is automatically initialized based on the node type.
3. **Run the Node**: Start the node as usual. The communication protocol will handle message transmission and reception.

## Gradual Migration

To gradually migrate from classical to quantum nodes:

1. **Deploy Quantum Nodes**: Start by deploying a few quantum nodes in the network.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Monitor the network performance and adjust the number of quantum nodes as needed.
3. **Full Migration**: Gradually increase the number of quantum nodes until the network is fully migrated.

## Conclusion

The enhancements to the QUPConsensus module ensure seamless interoperability between classical and quantum nodes, providing a robust and flexible framework for hybrid networks.
