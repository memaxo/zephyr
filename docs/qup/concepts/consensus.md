# Consensus Mechanism

This section covers the consensus mechanism used in the QUP module.

## Overview

The QUP module uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and quantum computing elements to achieve efficient and secure consensus in a blockchain network.

## Components

- **Block Proposal**: Nodes propose new blocks to be added to the blockchain.
- **Useful Work Generation**: Nodes perform useful work to contribute to the network.
- **Voting**: Nodes vote on proposed blocks.
- **Quorum**: A quorum of nodes must agree on a block for it to be added to the blockchain.
- **Block Validation**: Proposed blocks are validated before being added to the blockchain.
- **Adaptive Consensus Algorithms**: The consensus mechanism adapts to changing network conditions.
