# Useful Work

This section covers the concept of useful work in the QUP module.

## Overview

Useful work refers to computational tasks that contribute to the overall functionality and security of the blockchain network. In the QUP module, useful work is integrated into the consensus mechanism to ensure that nodes perform valuable computations.

## Types of Useful Work

- **Standard Useful Work**: Basic computational tasks that contribute to the network.
- **Enhanced Useful Work**: Advanced tasks that provide additional benefits to the network.
- **Storage Optimized Useful Work**: Tasks optimized for storage efficiency.
