# Quantum Computing

This section covers the role of quantum computing in the QUP module.

## Overview

Quantum computing is integrated into the QUP module to enhance the security and efficiency of the consensus mechanism. Quantum algorithms are used for tasks such as key generation, encryption, and signature verification.

## Quantum Algorithms

- **Quantum Key Distribution**: Securely distributes cryptographic keys using quantum mechanics.
- **Quantum Encryption**: Uses quantum algorithms to encrypt data.
- **Quantum Signature Verification**: Verifies signatures using quantum algorithms.
