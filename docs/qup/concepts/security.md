# Security

This section covers the security measures implemented in the QUP module.

## Overview

The QUP module incorporates various security measures to protect the blockchain network from attacks and ensure the integrity of the consensus mechanism.

## Security Measures

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Uses cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling to ensure the reliability of the network.
- **Validator Security**: Ensures that validators are secure and trustworthy.
